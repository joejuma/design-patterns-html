# Left Side Panel (Design Pattern)

## What is it?
A panel on the left side of the page which spans the whole page's height, and when it overflows, can be scrolled inside of. This replicates the (very old-fashioned) iframe behavior that was once popular on the web.

## When to use?
When you want to create a separate, scrolling panel of information, often a menu, on the left side of the page.
